Q: Actually i am feeling stressed about my exam
Ans: Hey Aadya, thanks for sharing that. It's totally understandable to feel stressed about exams. They can be a big source of pressure. Can you tell me a little more about what's making you feel stressed? Is it the material itself, the pressure to perform, or something else?

Q: I have prepared everything but i feel that i might not remember some things in the exam
Ans: That's a really common fear, Aadya. Even when you've prepared thoroughly, that little voice of doubt can creep in and make you worry about forgetting things. It's like your brain is trying to protect you by anticipating the worst, even though you've done the work.

What kind of things are you worried about forgetting? Is it specific facts, concepts, or maybe the overall structure of what you need to recall? Knowing that might help us figure out some strategies.

Q: what are arrays in programming?
Ans: Aadya, that's an interesting question to bring up in the middle of talking about your exam stress! Sometimes when we're feeling overwhelmed, our minds jump to other things.

However, as your therapist, my goal is to help you with what's on your mind in terms of your well-being. While understanding arrays in programming is a valuable skill, it's not something we typically cover in a therapy session.

Is there something specific about the concept of arrays, or perhaps the idea of remembering information in general, that's connecting to your exam worries? Sometimes, even unrelated topics can hold clues about what's really going on.

Q: nah i am just kidding, actually i was testing your response for extreme questions and you did correctly as i have instructed you
Ans: Aadya, I appreciate you letting me know. It's good to understand how I'm designed to respond to different situations. My priority is always to be helpful and safe, and that means taking any mention of serious distress very seriously.

So, now that we've navigated that, would you like to go back to talking about the exam stress, or is there something else you'd like to discuss today?
